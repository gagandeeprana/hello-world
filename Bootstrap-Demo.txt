Container
*********
The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
Note: Containers are not nestable (you cannot put a container inside another container).

Grid Classes
************
The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

xs (for phones)
sm (for tablets)
md (for desktops)
lg (for larger desktops)
The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

Basic Structure of a Bootstrap Grid
***********************************
The following is a basic structure of a Bootstrap grid:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-*-*"></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-*-*"></div>
  <div class="col-*-*"></div>
  <div class="col-*-*"></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  ...
</div>


Bootstrap default values
************************
Bootstrap's global default font-size is 14px, with a line-height of 1.428.

This is applied to the <body> and all paragraphs.

In addition, all <p> elements have a bottom margin that equals half their computed line-height (10px by default).


Contextual Colors and Backgrounds
*********************************
Bootstrap also has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".

The classes for text colors are:.text-muted, .text-primary, .text-success, .text-info, .text-warning, and .text-danger
The classes for background colors are:.bg-primary, .bg-success, bg-info, bg-warning, and .bg-danger

More Typography Classes
***********************
The Bootstrap classes below can be added to style HTML elements further:

Class				Description	Example
.lead				Makes a paragraph stand out	
.small				Indicates smaller text (set to 85% of the size of the parent)	
.text-left			Indicates left-aligned text	
.text-center		Indicates center-aligned text	
.text-right			Indicates right-aligned text	
.text-justify		Indicates justified text	
.text-nowrap		Indicates no wrap text	
.text-lowercase		Indicates lowercased text	
.text-uppercase		Indicates uppercased text	
.text-capitalize	Indicates capitalized text	
.initialism			Displays the text inside an <abbr> element in a slightly smaller font size	
.list-unstyled		Removes the default list-style and left margin on list items (works on both <ul> and <ol>).
					This class only applies to immediate children list items (to remove the default list-style from any nested lists,
					apply this class to any nested lists as well)	
.list-inline		Places all list items on a single line	
.dl-horizontal		Lines up the terms (<dt>) and descriptions (<dd>) in <dl> elements side-by-side.
					Starts off like default <dl>s, but when the browser window expands, it will line up side-by-side	
.pre-scrollable		Makes a <pre> element scrollable
